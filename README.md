# cts-viz-of-the-month
Monthly visualizations about California Teachers Study data, published on the CTS website (www.calteachersstudy.org) blog.

In the folder for each CTS Viz of the Month, you will find an image file of a visualization as well as the code that was used to make it.

The CTS encourages others to take inspiration from, use and copy the visualizations published in this series. Please be sure to acknowledge the CTS funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) that made all of this possible.
